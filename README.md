# MachineLearning I and II course materials

This repository contains labaratory(practical) and theoretical works that were conducted for the machine learning I and II courses at the University of Amsterdam. Some theoretical works are missing due the fact that they were submitted on a paper that has never been returned back by the grader. 
The code for the practical assignments is written in python as available in the ipython format.
