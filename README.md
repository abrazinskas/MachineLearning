# MachineLearning I and II course materials

This repository contains labaratory(practical) and theoretical works that were conducted for the machine learning I and II courses at the University of Amsterdam. 
Some theoretical works are missing due the fact that they were submitted on paper that has never been returned back by the grader(TA). 
The code for the practical assignments is written in python as available in the ipython format. 

## Machine learning I

### Course description
Machine learning is concerned with learning predictive algorithms from data. In this course you will learn about supervised learning (classification and regression), unsupervised learning (clustering and dimensionality reduction). 
Special attention will be paid to statistically analyzing the results of applying an algorithm to a particular problem. You will learn the theory of machine learning in class and practice the theory during homework sessions.
You will gain hands-on experience through a number of coding projects where you implement some of the algorithms.
